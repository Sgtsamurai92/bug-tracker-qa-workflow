# Test Fixes and Improvements

## Changes Made (October 16, 2025)

### 1. README.md Updates
- **Removed all emojis** for a more professional appearance
- Updated with accurate repository information
- Added clearer instructions for running tests
- Emphasized the need to start Flask app before tests

### 2. Browser Visibility
**Before:** Tests ran in headless mode by default
**After:** Browser is now visible by default

- Changed condition: `if os.environ.get('HEADLESS') == 'true':`
- Browser will only be hidden when you explicitly set: `$env:HEADLESS="true"`
- This allows you to see exactly what the tests are doing

### 3. Increased Wait Times
**Problem:** Tests were failing due to timing issues

**Changes:**
- Implicit wait: 10s → 15s
- Explicit wait: 10s → 15s
- Element timeout: 10s → 15s

**Files Modified:**
- `automation/conftest.py`
- `automation/pages/base_page.py`

### 4. Added Explicit Waits in Tests
**Problem:** Pages weren't fully loaded before assertions

**Changes Added:**
- 2-second wait after login before checking dashboard
- 2-second wait after bug creation before verifying
- 2-second wait after applying filters
- 2-second wait after clicking edit button

**Files Modified:**
- `automation/tests/test_login_valid_invalid.py`
- `automation/tests/test_bug_crud.py`
- `automation/tests/test_filter_and_permissions.py`

### 5. Window Maximization
**Before:** Only maximized when not in headless mode
**After:** Always attempts to maximize window

**Benefits:**
- Better visibility during test execution
- More consistent element positioning
- Easier to debug issues

### 6. Enhanced Logging
**Added:**
- `--enable-logging` flag to Chrome
- `--v=1` for verbose output

**Benefits:**
- Easier to diagnose issues
- Better understanding of what's happening

## How to Run Tests Now

### With Browser Visible (Default)
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start Flask app
cd app
python app.py

# Terminal 2: Run tests
cd automation
pytest tests/ -v
```

### With Browser Hidden (Headless)
```powershell
$env:HEADLESS="true"
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Using the Test Runner Script
```powershell
.\run_tests.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Check if Flask is running
2. Run all tests with browser visible
3. Generate HTML report
4. Automatically open the report

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Tests still failing?
**Solution:**
1. Ensure Flask app is running on http://localhost:5000
2. Close any existing Chrome browser instances
3. Clear browser cache: Delete `.wdm` folder in your user directory
4. Update ChromeDriver: `pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager`

### Issue: Browser is too slow?
**Solution:**
- This is normal - the increased wait times ensure stability
- You can adjust wait times in `conftest.py` if needed
- For faster execution, use headless mode: `$env:HEADLESS="true"`

### Issue: Can't see what's happening?
**Solution:**
- Tests now run with browser visible by default
- Watch the browser window during test execution
- Check screenshots in `automation/reports/screenshots/` for failures

### Issue: ChromeDriver errors?
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Clear webdriver cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $env:USERPROFILE\.wdm

# Reinstall webdriver-manager
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall webdriver-manager
```

## Performance Considerations

### Why increased wait times?
- **Stability over speed:** Ensures tests pass consistently
- **Network latency:** Accounts for slower connections
- **Page rendering:** Gives JavaScript time to execute
- **Element availability:** Ensures elements are ready before interaction

### When to use headless mode?
- **CI/CD pipelines:** GitHub Actions runs in headless
- **Faster execution:** Headless is faster (no rendering)
- **Batch testing:** When running many tests repeatedly

### When to use visible mode?
- **Development:** See what's happening in real-time
- **Debugging:** Understand why tests fail
- **Learning:** Watch the automation in action
- **Demonstrations:** Show tests to stakeholders

## What You'll See During Test Execution

1. **Chrome browser opens** (or stays hidden in headless mode)
2. **Browser navigates** to http://localhost:5000/login
3. **Login credentials** are entered
4. **Dashboard loads** with bug list
5. **Tests interact** with forms, filters, buttons
6. **Assertions verified** (pass/fail)
7. **Screenshots captured** on failures
8. **Browser closes** after each test

## Tips for Watching Tests

1. **Don't touch the browser** during test execution
2. **Watch the terminal** for test progress
3. **Notice the speed** - tests run with realistic timing
4. **See the waits** - you'll notice 2-second pauses
5. **Check screenshots** if tests fail

## Next Steps

1. **Run the tests:** Use `.\run_tests.ps1` or manual commands
2. **Watch the browser:** See the automation in action
3. **Check the report:** Review results in HTML format
4. **Adjust as needed:** Modify wait times if necessary
5. **Push to GitHub:** Your changes are already committed

✓ Browser visible by default  
✓ Increased wait times for stability  
✓ Explicit waits added in tests  
✓ Better error handling  
✓ Enhanced logging  
✓ Test runner script created
